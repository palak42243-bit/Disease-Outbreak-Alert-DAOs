# 🦠 Disease Outbreak Alert DAOs

## 📘 Project Description
**Disease Outbreak Alert DAOs** is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to **report**, **verify**, and **track** disease outbreaks transparently.  
The system uses **blockchain immutability** to prevent false reports and ensures **community-driven verification** through DAO governance principles.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a **transparent, community-driven alert system** that empowers people to take timely actions during disease outbreaks while maintaining global data integrity and accessibility.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Outbreak Reporting:** Anyone can report a disease outbreak with location and details.
- **Admin Verification:** A designated admin (or DAO in future) can verify reported outbreaks.
- **Immutable Records:** All data stored on the blockchain to prevent tampering.
- **Transparency:** Anyone can view verified and unverified reports.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- ✅ Integration with **DAO voting** for community-based outbreak verification.  
- ✅ Use of **IPFS** for storing detailed medical reports or media.  
- ✅ **Smart alerts** and **AI integration** for early prediction and response.  
- ✅ Cross-chain support for global interoperability.
